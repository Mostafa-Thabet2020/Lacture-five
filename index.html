            <h3>Ms. Searfoss</h3>
            <p>
                Megan Searfoss has been hoarding
                sneakers in Connecticut.
                Ms. Searfoss, the owner of two running stores
                in Darien and Ridgefield, Conn., would normally
                have about 3,000 pairs of shoes in stock ahead of the holiday season.
                But as she watched supply chain concerns in Vietnam mount this summer and into
                the fall, she secured a new storage facility and is now carrying around 4,100 pairs.

            <h3>The buildup</h3>
            <p>The buildup of running shoes in Connecticut is just one example of how supply chain woes and
                pandemic-related shortages are affecting thousands of small businesses around the United States this
                holiday season. While the widespread availability of vaccines is translating into a busier shopping
                season than last year, businesses of all sizes are grappling with the impact from factory shutdowns
                overseas, backups at ports, and trucking and other labor shortages.</p>
